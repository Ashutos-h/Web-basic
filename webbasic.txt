Answer 1) Access Token-: An access token is an object that encapsulates the security identity of a process or a thread.It is used to make security decisions and to store 
tamper-proof information about some system entity. Though, a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is also capable of holding additional free-form data 
that can be attached while the token is being created.An access token may contain following information:
1.Securtiy Identifier(SID) for a user's account.
2.A logon SID that identifies the current login session.
3.An owner SID.
4.Group's SID of which the user is a member.
5.List of privileges that a user has.
6.Source of access token.
7.Some other fields.

Steps to generate access token for an API(here assuming Twitter):
1.Go to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new and log in, if necessary.
2.Enter your desired Application Name, Description and your website address making sure to enter the full address including the http://.
3.Accept the terms and submit the form by clicking the "Create your Twitter Application" button.
4.After creating your Twitter Application click on the tab that says Keys and Access Tokens.
5.Click the Create my Access Token button.

My twitter access token: 998276400728555520-l1Hdf2WXzPmzUNdzwPKjSCulkIvsymT


Answer 2) IP address of some common sites using DNS Lookup:
          google.com:- 172.217.15.68
          facebook.com:- 31.13.65.36
          twitter.com:- 104.244.42.1
          amazon.com:- 205.251.242.103
	  yahoo.com:- 98.137.246.7

Answer 3) Difference between library and API.
      
	1.A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. you could use a library in a variety of projects.
	
	  An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program or library  without having direct access.

	  For example, in procedural languages like C, the library math.c contains the implementations of mathematical function, such as sqrt, exp, log etc. It contains the definition 
	  of all these functions.These function can be referenced by using the API math.h which describes and prescribes the expected behavior.

	2.Library is written in same language which is a collection of all the functionalities required for the use case.

	  API can be written in any language.

	  For example, Numpy is a library in Python, adding large support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high level mathematical functions 
          to operate on these arrays
